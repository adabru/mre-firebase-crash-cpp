# C++ CLI Application for Windows

A simple C++ command-line interface application built with CMake for Windows. Uses MSVC compiler.

Install or update the latest Visual Studio Community version.

Download the prebuilt Firebase C++ SDK release 13.0.0 from https://dl.google.com/firebase/sdk/cpp/firebase_cpp_sdk_13.0.0.zip. The zip file is ~8GB in size, the same goes for the extracted folder. Don't use the latest version (13.3.0) because of https://github.com/firebase/firebase-cpp-sdk/issues/1798. Extract the zip file to your Downloads folder (https://github.com/adabru/mre-firebase-crash-cpp/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt#L9).

Compile and run the application.
